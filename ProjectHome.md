This is an android project that uses OpenCV to locate an object (such as a bright yellow ping pong ball). It then uses bluetooth to communicate to a Mindstorm NXT robot to tell it the location of these objects. This robot can then be used to move towards the object. In my use case, I was building a pong robot that would move horizontally to hit the ping pong ball back to the other side.
